In this document, I set up the simulation I use for the paper 'Functional Mediation Analysis'

```{r}
library(fda)
library(refund)
```

```{r}
len     = 30
T_sup   = 1
timevec = seq(0,T_sup, length.out=len)
  
# Create bspline basis set
basis = create.bspline.basis(rangeval = c(0,T_sup), nbasis = 30, norder=6)

# Create delta
eval.bspline = eval.basis(timevec, basis)
# Create alpha

# Create beta

```
