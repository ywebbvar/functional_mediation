This implements simulation for testing my functional mediation function. 

Load the library 'refund'. It also loads the library 'fda' among many others.
```{r}
library(refund)
```

Load the canonical HRF function
```{r}
short_HRF <- read.table("C:/Users/Yenny/Documents/GitHub/functional_mediation/YennyHRF")
plot(1:length(short_HRF), short_HRF, type="l")
```

```{r}
Z = c(rep(0,20), short_HRF, rep(0,20))

sub=20
nbasis = 30
norder = 6


```
